 * @brief   Spectrophotometer used to measure optical density of suspension
 *          Multispectral component with several channel for different wavelengths.
 *          To determine relative value of measured channel and relative change in time spectrophotometer uses
 *              calibration which is saved persistently in EEPROM.
 *          This calibration should be done with empty cuvette or with cuvette containing grow medium.
 *          Spectrophotometer has own thread which performs tasks invoked by messages
 *              When message is routed into spectrometer by common core is placed into buffer.
 *              Spectrophotometer thread then processes messages in FIFO order.
