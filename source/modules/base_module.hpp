 * @brief   Base interface class for all modules in device

 *              - Common thread which dispatches received messages to router
 *              - Common core which is component present in all modules and is responsible for processing of messages which must be supported by all modules
 *          Also contains information about module type and instance enumeration, this are accessible via
 *              static methods using somewhat hidden and dirty singleton pattern
 *          Every module class should be derived from this class
